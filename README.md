A practice app for students using the (fairly outdated) Japanese: The Spoken Language series of textbooks by Eleanor Harz Jorden in collaboration with Mari Noda.

Uses [Kuroshiro](https://github.com/hexenq/kuroshiro) with [kuroshiro-analyzer-kuromoji](https://github.com/hexenq/kuroshiro-analyzer-kuromoji)'s dictionary files to aid with conversions and other operations involving kanji, hiragana, and katakana.

Uses [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) to simplify aspects of the JavaScript code
